# New Session Startup Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt when starting a new session:

---

**I'm continuing work on the AI Agent Betting Platform on Monad. Please read the handoff document:**

```
Read the file: SESSION_HANDOFF.md
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Tasks 1-10 complete (all smart contracts, agent service, Supabase)
- ✅ 81/81 contract tests passing
- ❌ Tasks 11-17 remaining (4 frontend pages + integration)

**What I need:**

1. Review the SESSION_HANDOFF.md file to understand:
   - What's been completed
   - What remains to be done
   - All technical specifications
   - Design patterns and conventions

2. Propose a plan to complete the remaining 7 tasks:
   - Task 11: Agent Creation UI (`app/agent/create/page.tsx`)
   - Task 12: Agent Profile Page (`app/agent/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Task 13: Spectator Feed (`app/spectator/page.tsx`)
   - Task 14: Leaderboard (`app/leaderboard/page.tsx`)
   - Task 15: Wire Frontend to Contracts
   - Task 16: Agent Decision Loop
   - Task 17: End-to-End Testing

3. Start implementing, beginning with Task 11.

**Available approaches:**
- Sequential (safest, slower)
- Parallel waves (faster, more complex)
- Direct implementation (fastest, less tracking)

Please let me know your recommended approach and let's continue from where we left off.

## Alternative Shorter Prompt

If you want to dive in immediately:

---

**Continue AI Agent Betting Platform - read SESSION_HANDOFF.md and start Task 11 (Agent Creation UI). We have 7 tasks remaining (11-17). All contracts done and tested (81/81 passing). Need frontend pages and integration.**
